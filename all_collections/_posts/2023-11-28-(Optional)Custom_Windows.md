This is the first step and it is completely optional 

So the first thing we have to do is use a custom windows iso since stock is not completely focused on gaming tasks.

There are three methods 

1. Custom ISO

2. AME Wizard and a Playbook 

3. BOTH ('Cause why not?)

For 1ST method :

Download a custom Windows ISO
Like : Tiny11,<a href="https://www.youtube.com/c/GHOSTSPECTRE/videos">Ghost Spectre</a>
I have not used Tiny11 so i dont have much to say about it.
To install ghost spectre
1.Go to their channel with the link above 
2.Click on their latest video
3.Download from discription(Password is given according to version of Windows that you are downloading and yes it is also in the discription of the video)
4.Unzip using 7zip 
5.Burn the iso to a pendrive using the tool called <a href="https://rufus.ie/en/">Rufus</a>
6.Boot the pendrive
7.Format your drive and create a new partition from unallocated space(Recommended)
8.Install to a partition and let the magic happen!

Now for 2nd method :
 1.Download <a href="https://ameliorated.io/">AME Wizard</a>
 2.Download a playbook such as <a href="https://atlasos.net/">Atlas OS</a> OR <a href="https://revi.cc/revios/download">Revi OS</a>
 3.Extract both the AME Wizard and the Playbook 
 4.Run AME Wizard and select the playbook
 5.Follow the instructions and customize features as you like.
 6.Restart
 
AND FINALLY
The Third Method :
1. DO 1st method
2. DO 2nd method on top
3. performance hax haha
