1.Should you install custom windows11?
Maybe?
Custom iso windows 11 usually comes debloated and tweaked but that does not mean you should install them as they may pose a risk of containing malware and you might not notice since this iso was built by someone else.

Now what? You can make your own custom iso or just debloat stock windows
how to make custom iso? ([WinCustom](https://github.com/alfinauzikri/WinCustom)) i wont cover this topic since i will be using stock windows.

2.Debloating and basic tweaks

Using ([Hellzerg's Optimizer](https://github.com/hellzerg/optimizer)) which is an open source optimizer constantly updated and active as of now.

  1.Download the latest release for windows and run Optimizer-xy.z.exe as admin


  2.Now that it's running right click on a tweak to see what it does 


  3.In the General tab follow these tweaks.
  Optimize Performance (optional) does not actually increase performance lol
  Optimizer Network (Recommended) Not sure about it but if you do gaming should decrease ping
  Disable Error Reporting (Recommended) Does not send crash reports to microsoft
  Disable Sticky Keys (Optional) disables annoying sticky keys 
  Disable all telemetry app settings (Recommended) disables telemetry for selected apps 
  Now for people using HDD or low end pcs or both,
  Disable SuperFetch(Optional) mixed opinions on reddit, if this service uses too much hard disk disable it (dont disable if u have ssd)
  Disable NTFS Time Stamp (Recommended) ...
  Disable SearchIndexing (Recommended) ...


  Now in the Windows11 Tab follow these,
  Disable MyPeople (Optional)
  Enable Long Paths(Optional)
  Taskbar tweaks as you want them 
  Disable everything in privacy section (Recommended)
  Enable Gaming Mode (Recommended)
  

  In UWP apps section untick only uninstallable and refresh (Only if you know what you're doing)
  And delete apps which are resource consuming bloatware.
  

  In the cleaner section clean up some space by selecting desired options

  Now close the optimizer and reboot or dont whatever you prefer (Tweaks will be applied after you reboot.)
